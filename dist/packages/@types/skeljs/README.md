# Skel

_**DEPRECATED! Use [Responsive Tools](https://github.com/ajlkn/responsive-tools) instead thx**_

Skel is a lightweight framework for building responsive sites and web apps.

- Minified production versions: [`dist/`](dist/)
- Documentation: [Skel](docs/skel.md), [Layout](docs/skel-layout.md), [Viewport](docs/skel-viewport.md), and [Skel.scss](docs/skel.scss.md)
- Unminified sources: [`src/`](src/)
- Baseline, a simple boilerplate built on Skel + Skel.scss: [github.com/ajlkn/baseline](http://github.com/ajlkn/baseline)

## Modules

Previous versions of Skel were basically monolithic (ie. `skel.min.js` contained **all** of Skel's functionality, even if you didn't need all of it). As of version 3, Skel uses a modular approach to give you more flexibility in how you use it. Here's how it (currently) breaks down:

- **Skel** (`skel.min.js`)

	_(Main framework)_ Provides JS access to CSS breakpoints, events, and other tools.

- **Layout** (`skel-layout.min.js`)

	_(Module)_ Adds CSS and page layout tools, including a CSS grid system, browser resets and more.

- **Viewport** (`skel-viewport.min.js`)

	_(Module)_ Adds simplified viewport management (including support for multiple viewport `<meta>` tags).

- **Skel.scss** (`_skel.scss`)

	_(Sass framework)_ A Sass-based implementation of Skel. Merges certain aspects of Skel and its Layout module (while adding some handy new mixins). Designed to work independently **or** in conjunction with Skel for added effect.
